# Why should you care?

Decentralized apps are replacements for centralized services with several significant advantages:

* **Open APIs / composability:** decentralized apps can be called atomically by other decentralized apps, allowing developers to build more complex functionality by stacking existing components.
* **Transparency:** app logic is expressed purely through code, so anyone can review the logic for side effects. State is transparent and auditable; proof of reserves in DeFi is the default.
* **Censorship-resistance and credible neutrality:** anyone can submit transactions or upload applications to a permissionless network.
* **Global reach:** anyone with access to the internet can access crucial financial services, including unbanked/underbanked users.

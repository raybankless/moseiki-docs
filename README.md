# Hello, we are Moseiki.

In Moseiki we believe that, even though web 3 technologies are taking over, you (the people) are the main driver of inspiration and creativity. Because of that every individual and their ideas have unparalleled value.&#x20;

As a platform that believes in the power of technology, creativity and self-expression, we think that today’s popular social media platforms fail to create excitement, provide the right tools to empower ideas also they fail to create a just content ownership system. We need something new to keep up with digital transformation but also it should be able to appeal to larger audiences.

<summary>What is Moseiki?</summary>

Moseiki is an adaptation-oriented Web3 Social Networking dApp and Web3 Social infrastructure provider. Our app provides account, content, and data ownership to you, allowing you to create and share posts, photos, and short-form videos with AI support on any topic, whether it can be turned into NFTs or not. This way, you and we are benefiting from the best of two worlds (Web2 and Web3)

One of our unique ways of interpreting content and consumption is our disappearing content pool. If the content hasn't been turned into an NFT, it disintegrates into a void within 22 days, 22 min, and 22 sec. Another method of us flipping and turning the table is our willingness towards rewarding content creators. Through Moseiki's monetization tools, content creators of all sizes and followings can generate meaningful revenue from their contributions to the platform.

<summary>Why are we doing this?</summary>

We are a team of international professionals who are curious about the extents of web3 technologies but also we have expertise in creating easy to use user experiences. From our perspective, for web 3 technologies to reach more people they must be easier to use and adapt to today’s social media experiences.  So, we are on a journey of transformation, constant curiosity, and change.

We believe that together, we can rewrite the rules and create a digital world that puts people first, co-existing with digital tools to support them where they are the true owner of the content they created.

**Here's how we keep your messages safe:**

* **Encrypted from the Start:** Your messages are scrambled before they even leave your device. It's like sending a coded message, except the code changes with every word.
* **Only You Hold the Key:** The decryption key that unlocks your messages resides solely on your device. No servers, no corporations, no shadowy figures - just you and your conversation partner.
* **Leakproof Layers:** The encrypted messages would remain incomprehensible to anyone without the key. It's like trying to read a locked diary in a foreign language.
* **No Metadata Mischief:** Unlike traditional platforms that track your every message, Moseiki keeps your metadata private too. No algorithms piecing together your life story from digital breadcrumbs.

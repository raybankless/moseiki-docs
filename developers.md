# Developers

Buidl before it was cool

We know how imperative the dev community is therefore we wanted to present you with the tools to allow you to create whatever you deem necessary. Tinker around with it, modify it, build on top of it or just use it in your own way.&#x20;

Moseiki is and always will be a pro-dev entity.&#x20;

Here's how to get started

### Post Minting API

Users can easily mint and airdrop NFTs on-demand via a single API call. Our service handles NFT minting at scale and takes care of all end-user operations.

### How to capitalize on Moseiki as is?

Our infrastructure provides a number of features that make it ideal for building web3 socials, including:

* **Unique domain names:** Moseiki domains are unique, non-fungible tokens (NFTs) that can be used to identify users and applications. This allows for a more secure and decentralized way to manage identities and relationships.&#x20;
* **Persistent data storage:** Moseiki uses decentralized storage to store data. This ensures that data is always accessible, even if a particular application or server goes offline.&#x20;
* **Interoperability:** Moseiki is designed to be interoperable with other web3 platforms. This makes it easy for developers to build on Moseiki in a chain-agnostic manner.

### Adapt our tech into yours

Open your platform to a world of possibilities with Moseiki Infra. While many Web3 Social Infras obsess over pure decentralization, leaving user experience behind, we've built modular building blocks with both in mind.

And for the independent minds driving progress? We see you. Submit your feature proposals and become an architect of the Moseiki ecosystem.

That's why our Infra acts as the toolset that allows you to build on top of existing social apps and our platform.

The range of tools is as follows:
